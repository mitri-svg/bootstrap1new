                            <strong>Ronaldo</strong> has five children. He first became a father to a son, who was born

                            17 June 2010 in the United States.[610] He has full custody of the child and has not
                            publicly
                            revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her.[611][612] In January 2015,
                            Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.[613]

                            Ronaldo became a father to twins,[614] born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via
                            surrogacy.
                            He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodríguez,[615]
                            who
                            gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017.[616] The couple expected a pair of twins in
                            2022.
                            The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.[617][618]

                            Ronaldo's father, José, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September
                            2005 when Ronaldo was 20.[619]

                            At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László
                            Bölöni,
                            who was impressed with his dribbling.[34] He subsequently became the first player to play
                            for
                            the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within

                            single season.[25] Sporting CP B was the 1st team in his senior career, where he debuted in

                            Divisão B championship played in the Azores.[35] On 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his
                            debut in
                            the Primeira Liga, playing for Sporting CP's main team against Braga

                            <strong>Messi</strong> has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of
                            Rosario.[644] He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his
                            childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player.[645] After keeping
                            their
                            relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in
                            January
                            2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the
                            Barcelona–Espanyol
                            derby.[646]

                            "Leo is not shy. He's introverted. He's reserved."

                            — Endocrinologist Diego Schwarzstein,[note 5] who addressed Messi's growth hormone
                            deficiency
                            from 1997 to 2001.
                            Messi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed
                            the
                            ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012,
                            before
                            confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.[648] Thiago was born in Barcelona

                            During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the
                            club's ranks, debuting for four youth teams in a single campaign.[31] After being named
                            player
                            of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he
                            played
                            only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he
                            scored
                            18 goals in 11 league games.[32][33] Messi was then one of several youth players called up
                            to
                            strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly
                            explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team:
                            "He

                            Dantas,[373] and a daughter, Mavie, born on 7 October 2023, with girlfriend Bruna
                            Biancardi.[374] He has a very close sibling relationship with his sister Rafaella Beckran,
                            and
                            honoured her by tattooing her face on his arm, while Beckran tattooed her brother's eyes on
                            her
                            arm.[375]

                            Neymar is a Christian,[11][12] and follows the Pentecostal branch of the religion.[376]
                            Neymar
                            has spoken about his faith saying: "Life only makes sense when our highest ideal is to serve
                            Christ!"[377] Additionally, he has sometimes worn a headband with the words "100%
                            Jesus".[378]
                            Neymar reportedly also tithes (10%) his income to his church and has named Kaká as his
                            religious
                            role model.[379] Each year, Neymar organises a charity match with fellow Brazilian
                            footballer
                            Nenê in Nenê's hometown of Jundiaí, with the purpose of raising food for needy
                            families.[380] In
                            addition to his native Portuguese, Neymar also speaks Spanish.[381][382]

                            Neymar began playing football at an early age and he was soon spotted by Santos who offered
                            him
                            a contract in 2003, where he was inducted into their youth academy, which has, in the past,
                            produced Brazilian internationals like Coutinho, Clodoaldo, Diego, Elano and Alex. He also
                            joined the likes of Pepe, Pelé and Robinho in starting out his career at the club, nicknamed
                            Peixe.[20] While in the youth academy, Neymar met Paulo Henrique Ganso, becoming good
                            friends in
                            the process. Aged 14, Neymar travelled to Spain for try outs with the Real Madrid youth
                            team. He
                            did not stay in Madrid, however, as his father decided at the time that he preferred the
                            young
                            prodigy to keep growing up while playing at Santos.[21][22]

                            Neymar has signed many sponsorship deals since his reputation began to grow from the age of
                            17. In March 2011, he signed an 11-year contract with American sportswear company Nike,[393]
                            which ended in August 2020 after a Nike employee made a sexual assault complaint against
                            him.[394][395] Neymar has since signed with German sportswear company Puma.[396] Still in
                            March 2011, Panasonic paid US$2.4 million to secure Neymar's services for two years. Prior
                            to signing for Barcelona, France Football had ranked Neymar 13th in its list of the world's
                            richest players in 2012, with total earnings of $18.8 million for the previous 12
                            months.[397] He has also signed other sponsorships from Volkswagen, Tenys Pé Baruel, Lupo,
                            Ambev, Claro, Unilever and Santander.[398][399][400][401]

                            In 2018, France Football ranked Neymar the third-highest-paid footballer in the world,
                            earning €81.5m ($95m) for a calendar year in combined income from salaries, bonuses and
                            endorsements deals.[402] In 2019, Forbes ranked Neymar the world's third-highest-paid
                            athlete (after Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo) with earnings of $105 million for the

                            There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and
                            this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid
                            is known as "The Classic" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs
                            were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well
                            as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural
                            tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of
                            the Spanish Civil War.[199] Over the years, the head-to-head record between the two clubs is
                            102 victories for Madrid, 100 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[200]

                            The club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon
                            and the bat of King James, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the
                            other a palm.[31] The club shared Barcelona's coat of arms, as a demonstration of its
                            identification with the city and a desire to be recognised as one.[275] In 1910, the club
                            held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala,
                            who at the time played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club
                            wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the
                            upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.[276]

                            On 22 October 1899, Swiss Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his
                            wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé
                            on 29 November. Eleven players attended – Walter Wild (the first president of the club),
                            Luis de Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles
                            Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was
                            born.[25][26]


                            A formation of FC Barcelona in 1903
                            FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the
                            Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1901, the club participated in the very
                            first football competition played on the Iberian Peninsula, the Copa Macaya, narrowly losing
                            to Hispania AC, but in the following year, Barça won the tournament, the club's first-ever
                            piece of silverware,[27] and then participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to
                            Bizcaya (a combination of players from Athletic Club and Bilbao FC) in the final.

                            Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and
                            students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford
                            University graduates. They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La
                            Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at
                            Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new
                            club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from
                            Sky Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid
                            president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future
                            presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club.
                            Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as "New Foot-Ball
                            Club".[38][39][40] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been
                            elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[4] The Padrós brothers summoned other
                            football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family business.

                            Real Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the Goal! football movie
                            trilogy, Goal! 2: Living the Dream... (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star
                            Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season.
                            The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to
                            Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use
                            many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film
                            included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl,
                            Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and
                            Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho,
                            Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg,
                            Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di
                            Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing.[324]

                            There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and
                            this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona
                            is known as "The Classic" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs
                            were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well
                            as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural
                            tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of
                            the Spanish Civil War.[244] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 100
                            victories for Madrid, 97 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[245]
